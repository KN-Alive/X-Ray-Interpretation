# ü´Ä X-ray Interpretation System for Cardiac Implantable Devices

This project aims to develop a machine learning‚Äìbased system for the automatic interpretation of chest X-ray images containing cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), such as pacemakers or defibrillators.

The system combines image analysis with a web-based application to support healthcare professionals in verifying device placement, classifying device types, and identifying abnormalities.
